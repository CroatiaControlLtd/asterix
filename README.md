Asterix is Python module and standalone application used for reading and parsing of EUROCONTROL ASTERIX protocol data from stdin, file or network multicast stream.

ASTERIX stands for All Purpose STructured EUROCONTROL SuRveillance Information EXchange.
It is an ATM Surveillance Data Binary Messaging Format which allows transmission of harmonised information between any surveillance and automation system.
ASTERIX defines the structure of the data to be exchanged over a communication medium, from the encoding of every bit of information up to the organisation of the data within a block of data - without any loss of information during the whole process.
