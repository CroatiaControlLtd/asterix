asterix
=======

Asterix is utility used for reading and parsing of Eurocontrol ASTERIX protocol data from stdin, file or network multicast stream.

ASTERIX stands for All Purpose STructured Eurocontrol SuRveillance Information EXchange.
It is an ATM Surveillance Data Binary Messaging Format which allows transmission of harmonised information between any surveillance and automation system.
ASTERIX defines the structure of the data to be exchanged over a communication medium, from the encoding of every bit of information up to the organisation of the data within a block of data - without any loss of information during the whole process.
More about ASTERIX protocol you can find here: http://www.eurocontrol.int/services/asterix

	-v,--verbose	Show more information during program execution
	-P,--pcap	Input is from PCAP file
	-O,--oradis	Asterix packet is encapsulated in ORADIS packet
	-R,--oradispcap	Input is from PCAP file and
			Asterix packet is encapsulated in ORADIS packet
	-F,--final	Asterix packet is encapsulated in FINAL packet.
	-H,--hdlc	Asterix packet is encapsulated in HDLC packet.
	-l,--line	Output will be printed as one line per item. This format is suitable for parsing.
